# BloodMatch - Connecting Lives

Welcome to BloodMatch, an innovative app built in React Native that aims to save lives by connecting blood donors and recipients in a fast, efficient, and humane way. Inspired by the “match” concept of popular platforms, BloodMatch creates an experience that facilitates interaction between people looking to help and those in need of support.

## ✨ What is BloodMatch?

BloodMatch is an app that allows users to create a profile where they can specify their blood type, location, and availability to donate or receive blood.

Similar to dating apps, users can search for compatible profiles, “like” them, and if there is a “match,” start a conversation within the app to coordinate the donation.

## 🚀 Main Features

* Custom Profile Creation: Each user can set up their profile with essential information such as blood type, availability, phone number, etc.
* Compatibility System: Find donors and recipients based on your blood type and location, among other filters
* Easy Matchmaking: Like compatible profiles and connect when both parties agree.
* Integrated Messaging: Communicate directly with your matches to coordinate blood donation.
* Notification System: Receive alerts for new matches, messages, and urgent requests.
* Focus on Privacy: Designed to ensure the security and privacy of user data.
