## ‚ú® What is BloodMatch?

BloodMatch is an app that allows users to create a profile where they can specify their blood type, location, and availability to donate or receive blood.

Similar to dating apps, users can search for compatible profiles, ‚Äúlike‚Äù them, and if there is a ‚Äúmatch,‚Äù start a conversation within the app to coordinate the donation.
